# Js Engine

A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code.

The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.

A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language (Machine Language).

# History of javascript engine

\- Javascript was mostly an interpreted language!

\- Every single line is interepreted and executed on ater the other

```
 let a=10
 let b=20
 let c=a+b;
```

\- This is quite a slow way to to stuff.
