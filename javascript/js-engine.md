# Js Engine

A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code.

The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.

A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language (Machine Language).
